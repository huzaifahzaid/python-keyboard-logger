# Python Keyboard Logger (Educational Project)

A simple and **educational keyboard input logger** built in Python using the `pynput` library.  
This project demonstrates how keystrokes can be captured, logged in a **human-readable format**, and properly handled for special keys.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Logs **keystrokes in readable format**  
- Handles **special keys**: Enter, Space, Tab, Backspace, etc.  
- Marks **start and end of each session**  
- Press **ESC** to stop logging  
- Timestamps can be added for better session tracking  
- Designed for **educational purposes**

- Python 3.x  
- `pynput` library  

Install `pynput` with:

```bash
pip install pynput


▶️ How to Run
